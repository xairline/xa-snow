Introduction
------------

Wgrib2 is a swiss army knife for grib2 files. You can use it inventory
or extract data. You can do basic database operations and other nifty
things.

GRIB-2 has arrived and has begun replacing the the older standard GRIB
(GRIB-1). Since GRIB-2 can reduce the file size by upto 80% (NAM,
JPEG2000 compression), converting to the new standard may be faster
than some expected.

Wgrib2 has been out in the wild since 9/16/2005 (alpha release). The
original version was rough around the edges but the new design helped
and now wgrib2 has much more functionality than the older wgrib.

*Important*: This is not the *official* Wgrib2 distribution. This is
             a derived version that has been converted to use
             the GNU autotools. Besides the build details it is 
             expect to be equivalent to NCEP's version.

Some Good Stuff
---------------

    * Almost trivial to add custom features!
    * Customized inventories
    * Table driven
    * Code is reorganized
    * Super easy integration of new and local options
    * wgrib2 knows the lat-lon of the individual grid points for several grids
    * Designed for multiple developers (hint, hint, hint)
    * Works with the partial-http downloading aka 
      "Fast Downloading of GRIB Files" 

Bad Stuff
---------
    * Uses external libraries (png,jpeg,netcdf,compression,grib2 decode) 
      which can make compiling and linking a real pain. At least all 
      the external libraries are in C.
    * interpolation to lat-lon values is done by nearest neighbor.
    * wind rotation is not handled 

Usage
-----
    * similar to wgrib but different
    * type wgrib2 to see primary options
    * inventory format is specified on command line by options
    * if no "inv" options are specified, -s is used 

Joining the development effort
------------------------------
    * Source code: knowledge of C and grib-2
    * Donated source code / non-trivial bug fixes must either be 
      GNU or public domain.
    * Prefer PD bug fixes for PD code and GNU bug fixes for GNU code.
    * Bug reports are important
    * Contact wesley.ebisuzaki@noaa.gov

Encoding data into grib (preliminary)

Some people need industrial strength encoders. The rest have lesser
needs. If you can find a grib2 file with the desired grid, then
encoding could be easier than you expected with the -grib_ieee option.

Code: 32 and 64 bits
--------------------

The code is designed to run on 32-bit and 64-bit computers. The
advantages of compiling it for 64-bit (integers/pointers) is that that
the code supports files that are larger than 2 GB. Note: NCEP runs the
64-bit version in operations. The trick for compiling with 64 bits is
to make sure all the libraries are 64 bits.

The code is being developed on a linux x86_32 platform in standard
C. Code is run on the AIX (64-bits) in NCEP operations.

Bugs
----

Please report then to wesley.ebisuzaki@noaa.gov. When you report bugs,
try to make them reproduceable on a linux machine. Sample data file
also help.

Distribution
------------

The source code modules for wgrib2 are in the public domain or under
the GNU licence depending on the authors of the various
modules. Wgrib2 uses libraries that are in the public domain, under
various GNU licences, the Image Power JPEG-2000 Public Licence, libpng
licence, the zlib licence, the netcdf licence and perhaps others. How
about one licence to rule them all?
