                         Binary Installation
                         ===================

There is a single binary file called "wgrib2" under sub-directory
bin/; place this binary anywhere in your path, typically
"/usr/local/bin" or even "$HOME/bin".


                    Building Wgrib2 from Sources
                    ============================

Quick Instructions
------------------

Here is the quickest way to build Wgrib2 from sources:

1) Choose a working directory and make sure you have GNU make.
2) Download the Supplemental Libraries (Supplibs)
   preferably pre-compiled, and untar them in this working directory
3) If you download the /supplibs/ sources instead, untar them in the
   same location and build: 

 % ln -s supplibs-2.x.y supplibs
 % cd supplibs/src
 % gmake install     (do not configure or issue a simple make)

 4) Download the Wgrib2 sources, untar them in this same working
      directory (supplibs/ and Wgrib2-x.y.z/ should be parallel)

 % cd Wgrib2-x.y.z/src
 % ./configure --help
 % ./configure --prefix=/some/path
 % make
 % make install

For Mantainers
--------------

When merging NCEP sources run bootstrap.sh to regenerate configure and the Makefiles.
